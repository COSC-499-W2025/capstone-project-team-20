**Weekly Goals Recap:**

This week, our team's main goal was to prepare functional and non-functional requirements based on our current understanding of the project. We accomplished this, created a draft, and gathered feedback from 3 other teams on areas that we could improve or change.

Using their feedback, we refined and clarified multiple requirements to ensure specificity and measurability. These activities both fit into Project Planning and Researching/learning new things. I also researched local data mining to try and strengthen my understanding and knowledge base of what the project was requiring.

We also collaborated as a team, in person and on a Google Doc, where we discussed multiple ideas, requirements, ethical considerations, and compared our requirements and understanding of the project relative to the other teams. This was my consideration for the "Something else" section that I had selected for tasks worked on.

Our last goal was to define more goals in our team's project board. We filled out a couple more issues, assigned people, and moved the tasks we already completed, to completed.


### **Date: September 22nd - September 28th**

**Weekly Goals Recap:**

This week, our teams goal was to prepare a system architecture diagram based on our current understanding of the project. Our team collectively worked on it and we created the diagram between Monday and Wednesday and gathered feedback from 4 other teams during the Wednesday class.

We are also working on our Project Proposal. We are adding issues into our GitHub project (Issues #10, #11, #12, #13) to distribute workload among our team members for the different sections of the proposal. I am working on the "Proposed Solution" section of the proposal, Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#11](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/11)

All of this went into project planning, assigning people to tasks, deciding on task priorities, writing class reports, helping others and receiving help for work completed.  


 ### **Date: September 29th - October 5th**

 **Tasks worked on:**

 **Weekly Goals Recap:**

 This week, our team's goal was to prepare a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for levels 0 and 1. Our team prepared a DFD Level 0 and DFD Level 1 for presentation and feedback on Wednesday. Our DFD's Level 0 and Level 1 were based off of our functional requirements from Week 1. We gathered feedback from and gave feedback to Teams 2, 5, and 10 for both levels of the DFD.
 
 No additional issues have needed to be added to our project board, so all that was included for the tasks worked on this week was writing class reports, preparing and giving presentations (for the DFD's), team meetings (in class and through discord), and collaborating together on DFD's level 0 and 1.

### **Date: October 6th - October 12th**

**Weekly Goals Recap:**

This week, our team created tasks in our project board and assigned them to members. We have started prioritizing what will need to be done first in order to have all of milestone 1 ready at the deadline. We also updated our DFD Level 1 and put it in our media folder in our repository. The README was also updated with our DFD Level 1. 

We have started some coding progress thus far, mainly skeletons of what will need to be done and collaborated on how our repository structure will be.
