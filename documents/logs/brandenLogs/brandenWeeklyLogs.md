**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team's main goal was to prepare functional and non-functional requirements based on our current understanding of the project. We accomplished this, created a draft, and gathered feedback from 3 other teams on areas that we could improve or change.

Using their feedback, we refined and clarified multiple requirements to ensure specificity and measurability. These activities both fit into Project Planning and Researching/learning new things. I also researched local data mining to try and strengthen my understanding and knowledge base of what the project was requiring.

We also collaborated as a team, in person and on a Google Doc, where we discussed multiple ideas, requirements, ethical considerations, and compared our requirements and understanding of the project relative to the other teams. This was my consideration for the "Something else" section that I had selected for tasks worked on.

Our last goal was to define more goals in our team's project board. We filled out a couple more issues, assigned people, and moved the tasks we already completed, to completed.

**Weekly Goals Recap:**

This week, our teams goal was to prepare a system architecture diagram based on our current understanding of the project. Our team collectively worked on it and we created the diagram between Monday and Wednesday and gathered feedback from 4 other teams during the Wednesday class.

We are also working on our Project Proposal. We are adding issues into our GitHub project (Issues #10, #11, #12, #13) to distribute workload among our team members for the different sections of the proposal. I am working on the "Proposed Solution" section of the proposal, Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#11](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/11)

All of this went into project planning, assigning people to tasks, deciding on task priorities, writing class reports, helping others and receiving help for work completed.
