**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team's main goal was to prepare functional and non-functional requirements based on our current understanding of the project. We accomplished this, created a draft, and gathered feedback from 3 other teams on areas that we could improve or change.

Using their feedback, we refined and clarified multiple requirements to ensure specificity and measurability. These activities both fit into Project Planning and Researching/learning new things. I also researched local data mining to try and strengthen my understanding and knowledge base of what the project was requiring.

We also collaborated as a team, in person and on a Google Doc, where we discussed multiple ideas, requirements, ethical considerations, and compared our requirements and understanding of the project relative to the other teams. This was my consideration for the "Something else" section that I had selected for tasks worked on.

Our last goal was to define more goals in our team's project board. We filled out a couple more issues, assigned people, and moved the tasks we already completed, to completed.
