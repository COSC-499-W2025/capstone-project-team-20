**Recap of Goals**

[#1]: https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/1

This week, our team collectively worked on determining an initial set of functional and non-functional requirements based on the given project specification.

In class discussion with other teams allowed for greater clarity on both the scope of the project, as well as areas of our requirements that could be improved upon. Feedback given was used to increase clarity and specificity of requirements listed.

We additionally outlined methods for testing each requirement, the target user groups, as well as a few short usage scenarios, which will provide a good starting point for the upcoming project proposal.
