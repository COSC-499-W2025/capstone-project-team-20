### Week 7 (October 13th - October 19th)

**Work Performed:**

- Branden Kennedy (42474551): Worked on The ConsentManager, closing Issues #30, #75, and #76. I also helped convert the WBS to a diagram, and added it into our repo's media folder and README, helping close issues [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#32](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/32) and Issue #48.
- Dylan Alexander (16394025): Worked on ConfigManager, closing issue #43 (Milestone 1 requirement 6) and it's subissues #71, #72 and #73. I also wrote us up a work breakdown structure, which Branden turned into a very lovely diagram.
- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): Worked on issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/52), which was on producing an analysis of skills in a chronological manner, closing the issue after further review with the team's constructive criticism, and wrote tests for it which were successful. Tested and evaluated other people's code for pr approvals.
- Sven Annist (42486720): Implemented the ProjectFile class (src/ProjectFile.py) and comprehensive unit tests (tests/test_project_file.py), closing issue #58. Key work included extracting file metadata from zipfile.ZipInfo (name, size, inferred file_type, last_modified), and validating against directory entries. [PR 85](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/pull/85) [Issue 58](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/58)
- Lex Nash (84668540): Did some work on the ProjectFile class (src/ProjectFile.py) -> [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/58). Implemented ZipParser (src/ZipParser.py) which takes a file path to a zip file, opens said zip file, and parses every file and folder, creating a tree representation of the file structure out of ProjectFile and ProjectFolder objects -> [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/59)

**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**

### Week 8 (October 20th - October 26th)

**Work Performed:**
- Branden Kennedy (42474551): Worked on extracting project metadata, specifically file sizes, dates, average sizes. This closed issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#99](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/99). I also worked on decomposing Issue #34 into multiple subissues (as its quite a large issue). Lastly, I tested and reviewed other team member's code, thoroughly reviewing PR's. 
- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): Worked on enhancing the project analytics and skill tracking functionality. Completed Issue #52, which introduced the SkillEvent class and helper methods for creating a chronological list of skills across projects. This feature allows project data to be structured and analyzed over time. Also completed Issue #78, implementing the Project dataclass for storing metadata such as project name, folder path, timestamps, and technical metrics. This dataclass forms the foundation for how projects are persisted and analyzed throughout the system. I also reviewed other other team member's code through PR's and provided review. I will be starting the new issues that I created for next week.
- Lex Nash (84668540): Completed the rest of the sub issues under issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#31](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/31). For this week this included issue #97 (tests for ZipParser), issue #127 (tests for ProjectFolder), issue #111(ZipParser.toString() which takes a root ProjectFolder and returns a String representation of every file and directory within the zipped folder and tests), and a bug fix (issue #119). Reviewed a single PR as that was all that was there at the time. Need to decide on tasks for next week.
- Dylan Alexander (16394025): Worked on refactoring ConfigManager into a StorageManager base class, Implemented Project dataclass, Implemented ProjectManager for storage of Project objects into the database, and did some refactoring of the database manager classes, adding docstrings and typehints where they were previously missing. I've linked these PRs and the code reviews I did this week in my personal log.
- Sven Annist (42486720): Worked on distinguishing individual projects from collaborative projects, as outlined in Issue #47, which was resolved in PR #101. This involved analyzing git-based authorship data extracted from project "/.git" directories to inventory authors and delineate individual commits from collaborative contributions. Additionally, created new issues for future development in response to team feedback (Issues #113, #123, and #124). I also conducted code reviews on PR #93 (Dylan's ConfigManager refactoring to StorageManager) and PR #110 (Lex's ZipParser tests)


**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**
- Issues #30 up to and including Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#111](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/111)

**Continuing tasks from last week and plan for the next week:**
- Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#34](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/34) is being decomposed into multiple subissues. Issue #99 is a subissue of #34 and has been closed. This week, further decomposition of the task will happen and they will be worked on, so it is continuing through to this week.
- Issue #96 Future adaptation of the chronological list of skills feature. This will involve extending the current timeline logic to incorporate project context and improved data visualization.

### Week 9 (October 27th - November 2nd)

**Work Performed:**
- Branden Kennedy (42474551): Worked on a FileCategorizer, including tests and ymls for categories.yml and ignored_directories.yml, as well as adding more items to languages.yml. This issue ended up being very extensive, also refactoring the ProjectMetadataExtractor to use the FileCategorizer. Closes Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#100](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/100). I also did multiple PR reviews and discussed with other team members about immediate future plans and what we can work on next to keep things running smoothly.

- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): Created the complete Skill Analyzer subsystem for the project, implementing the `SkillExtractor`, `FolderSkillAnalyzer`, and `analyze_any` modules. This feature enables the system to detect programming languages, frameworks, and tools used within uploaded repositories, and to assign heuristic proficiency scores based on code structure, testing density, and typing or documentation usage. I also designed and implemented the proficiency scoring model and integrated Docker/Compose test commands to make the system reproducible in all environments. Comprehensive unit tests were written to verify the accuracy of the analyzer, and I finalized the PR with full documentation and module-level explanations. Closes Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#36](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/36).

- Lex Nash (84668540): Created the ProgressBar.Bar class and associated tests, a progress bar object takes a total size in bytes of a group of files, and displays a progress bar which you can then update with the size of files you have finished analyzing to update the progress bar. The progress bars are designed to be quite precise as it uses unicode block characters to be able to divide each character width segment of the bar into 8 sub-segments. The plan going forward is to individually implement the progress bar into different parts of the project that involve looping through files. Closes issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#158](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/158).

- Dylan Alexander (16394025): Overhauled and fully implemented the Language Detector. Updated the ZIP parser to handle out-of-order/missing/empty directories, and correctly parse file paths containing spaces or semicolons. Refactored the ZIP parser to eliminate code duplication. Updated the Project dataclass to account for the storage of metrics our system computes. Refactored the get() and get_all() methods in StorageManager to return a generator for improved efficiency.

- Sven Annist (42486720): Implemented a comprehensive document handling system to address Issue #124, enabling the application to extract and process plaintext content from various document formats (.txt, .pdf, .docx). This involved creating a new, reusable DocumentScraper module responsible for orchestrating the text extraction process and a document_handler utility for format-specific parsing. The system was architected to be modular and testable, with the final implementation integrated directly into the main application workflow. main.py now calls ZipParser to extract a user-provided archive, then passes the resulting directory to the DocumentScraper to aggregate text content into a lookup table for future analysis.

**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**
- Issues #30 up to and including Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#151](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/151)

**Continuing tasks from last week and plan for the next week:**
- Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#142](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/142) for Branden. It was just started sunday and the issue that will be worked on this week, but it was started sunday so i am classifying it as a "continuing task"
- Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#36](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/36) for Kaan. I will be continuing this issue next week to expand the Skill Analyzer’s language coverage and ensure full compatibility with the Skill Detector by defining additional standards for classification and scoring.

### Week 11 (November 10th - November 16th)

**Work Performed:**
- Branden Kennedy (42474551): This week, I implemented the Project Analyzer and cleaned up main.py. The project analyzer synthesizes all of our analyzers into one location. It shows a simple menu where you can select which analyzer youd like to use, use all of them, analyze a new zipped folder, or exit the application. Closing Issue #142. I also implemented a full test suite for the project analyzer and did multiple PR reviews. 

- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): This week I compertmantalized the monolith of a feature I had which was the skill extractor, also making minor tweaks where necessary to make sure that the pr would be easier to review and incremental under issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#36](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/36). I also started working on the badge feature and implemented the basic qualifications of a badge as well as developing the system itself to be functional, working on issue #114. I also did multiple PR reviews of my team mates codes.

- Lex Nash (84668540): This week I implemented a progress bar into ZipParser, closing issue #160 and fixed a slight issue in another teammate's code, causing a test to fail, closing issue #182. Other than that I have been mostly focusing on reviewing teammate's code this week as I need to understand refactoring changes and new analysis tools in order to properly implement loading bars for them.

- Dylan Alexander (16394025):

- Sven Annist (42486720): Executed a comprehensive architectural refactoring of the Git repository analysis workflow. Repositioned GitRepoAnalyzer as a central orchestrator instead of a utility unit, significantly reducing complexity in main.py and improving overall code organization. Implemented an "upsert" (update/insert) mechanism in ProjectManager to prevent duplicate project record creation in the database. Additionally resolved a NameError in PDF document scraping logic by correcting pypdf library usage. Conducted a code review on PR #169 (ProgressBar x ZipParser). Closes Issues COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#113 and COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#123.

**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**
- Issues #30 up to and including 

**Continuing tasks from last week and plan for the next week:**

Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#114](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/36) for Kaan. I will be continuing this issue next week to expand the badge system and integrate it so that it works in tandem with the rest of the program.

Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#146](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/146) for Lex. Finishing off the sub issues needed for this, including refactoring changes to allow a wider range of uses for the progress bar.
