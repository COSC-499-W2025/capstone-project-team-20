### Week 7 (October 13th - October 19th)

**Work Performed:**

- Branden Kennedy (42474551): Worked on The ConsentManager, closing Issues #30, #75, and #76. I also helped convert the WBS to a diagram, and added it into our repo's media folder and README, helping close issues [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#32](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/32) and Issue #48.
- Dylan Alexander (16394025): Worked on ConfigManager, closing issue #43 (Milestone 1 requirement 6) and it's subissues #71, #72 and #73. I also wrote us up a work breakdown structure, which Branden turned into a very lovely diagram.
- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): Worked on issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/52), which was on producing an analysis of skills in a chronological manner, closing the issue after further review with the team's constructive criticism, and wrote tests for it which were successful. Tested and evaluated other people's code for pr approvals.
- Sven Annist (42486720): Implemented the ProjectFile class (src/ProjectFile.py) and comprehensive unit tests (tests/test_project_file.py), closing issue #58. Key work included extracting file metadata from zipfile.ZipInfo (name, size, inferred file_type, last_modified), and validating against directory entries. [PR 85](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/pull/85) [Issue 58](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/58)
- Lex Nash (84668540): Did some work on the ProjectFile class (src/ProjectFile.py) -> [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/58). Implemented ZipParser (src/ZipParser.py) which takes a file path to a zip file, opens said zip file, and parses every file and folder, creating a tree representation of the file structure out of ProjectFile and ProjectFolder objects -> [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/59)

**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**
- Issues #30 up to and including Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#82](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/82)

### Week 8 (October 20th - October 26th)

**Work Performed:**
- Branden Kennedy (42474551): Worked on extracting project metadata, specifically file sizes, dates, average sizes. This closed issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#99](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/99). I also worked on decomposing Issue #34 into multiple subissues (as its quite a large issue). Lastly, I tested and reviewed other team member's code, thoroughly reviewing PR's. 
- Necmi Kaan Sapoglu (17014796): Worked on enhancing the project analytics and skill tracking functionality. Completed Issue #52, which introduced the SkillEvent class and helper methods for creating a chronological list of skills across projects. This feature allows project data to be structured and analyzed over time. Also completed Issue #78, implementing the Project dataclass for storing metadata such as project name, folder path, timestamps, and technical metrics. This dataclass forms the foundation for how projects are persisted and analyzed throughout the system. I also reviewed other other team member's code through PR's and provided review. I will be starting the new issues that I created for next week.
- Lex Nash (84668540): Completed the rest of the sub issues under issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#31](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/31). For this week this included issue #97 (tests for ZipParser), issue #127 (tests for ProjectFolder), issue #111(ZipParser.toString() which takes a root ProjectFolder and returns a String representation of every file and directory within the zipped folder and tests), and a bug fix (issue #119). Reviewed a single PR as that was all that was there at the time. Need to decide on tasks for next week.

**Features included in the project plan for this milestone are:**
- Issues #30 up to and including Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#111](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/111)

**Continuing tasks from last week and plan for the next week:**
- Issue [COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20#34](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/issues/34) is being decomposed into multiple subissues. Issue #99 is a subissue of #34 and has been closed. This week, further decomposition of the task will happen and they will be worked on, so it is continuing through to this week.
- Issue #96 Future adaptation of the chronological list of skills feature. This will involve extending the current timeline logic to incorporate project context and improved data visualization.
