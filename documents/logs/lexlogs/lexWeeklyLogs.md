**Recap of Goals**

Our goal for this week was to come up with potential functional and non-functional requirements given a basic description of the project. We first discussed what kind of project we could make given the project description, we created a shared google doc and started writing ideas for how we could turn our ideas into functional and non-functional requirements.

We created a discord server in order to communicate effectively while not in class together. We used this and the google doc to collaborate on a finalized first draft for our proposed project requirements. We brought these requirements to the next class, and compared them to what other groups had proposed and listened to feedback.

We used the feedback of other groups to make our project requirements less vague, more realistic, and simpler to understand. We were also inspired by some of the ideas of other groups, such as those who implemented ethical considerations in their requirements.

We explored the github and started on creating a project board to keep track of issues.
