**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team produced a system architecture diagram and gathered feedback from other groups. Using this feedback, we've refined our ideas about the project. 

We've also been working on a project proposal document that clearly lays out the project scope, our proposed solution, use cases, requirements and testing. I will be working on drafting both positive and negative test cases for each requirement.
