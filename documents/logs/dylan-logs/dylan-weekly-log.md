**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team produced a system architecture diagram and gathered feedback from other groups. Using this feedback, we've refined our ideas about the project. 

We've also been working on a project proposal document that clearly lays out the project scope, our proposed solution, use cases, requirements and testing. I will be working on drafting both positive and negative test cases for each requirement.

**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team produced a data flow diagram and exchanged them with other groups in class. We offered feedback to the other groups, and they gave us feedback on our DFD diagram in return. We've taken this feedback and gained some valuable insights into how data will flow through our system and how different processes will interact.

**Weekly Goals Recap**

This week, our team held discussions over Discord in order to finalize our system architecture designs and will be providing links in our repositories README. 

As for myself, this week I made a PR establishing an initial skeleton setup and basic test framework for our project. This included making a comprehensive .gitignore, establishing the required folder structure, as well as initializing pytest. It's very basic, but it gives us a good place to start building.
