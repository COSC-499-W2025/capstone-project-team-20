## Weekly Goals Recap:

This week, our team made a diagram of our system architecture & shared them with various other teams to get feedback on our design and lean from what other teams are doing to refine our ideas. Additionally, we've been developing our project proposal. As of now we've outlined a proposed solution in addition to several use cases along with the correspondent UML use case diagram which I constructed. We will be working on outlining our workload distribution.

With this information we will work on finalizing our requirements and design elements and make a WBS to hopefully get going with development soon.

### Weekly Goals Recap:
This week, our team finalized the WBS for Milestone 1, converted it into prioritized GitHub issues on the project board, and did minor repo housekeeping; I implemented the ProjectFile node and its tests ([PR #85](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-20/pull/85)) to support the upcoming ZipParser, extracting core metadata (name, size, type, last modified) from ZipInfo and maintaining a parent reference for tree integration; next week we plan to wire ProjectFile into an initial ZIP parsing flow, further break down parser tasks and test targets
