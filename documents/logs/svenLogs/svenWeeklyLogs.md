## Weekly Goals Recap:

This week, our team made a diagram of our system architecture & shared them with various other teams to get feedback on our design and lean from what other teams are doing to refine our ideas. Additionally, we've been developing our project proposal. As of now we've outlined a proposed solution in addition to several use cases along with the correspondent UML use case diagram which I constructed. We will be working on outlining our workload distribution.
