## Weekly Goals Recap:

This week, our team made a diagram of our system architecture & shared them with various other teams to get feedback on our design and lean from what other teams are doing to refine our ideas. Additionally, we've been developing our project proposal. As of now we've outlined a proposed solution in addition to several use cases along with the correspondent UML use case diagram which I constructed. We will be working on outlining our workload distribution.

### Tasked worked on:

## Weekly Goals Recap:
This week, our team constructed level 0 & 1 DFD Diagrams to display and compare our data flows with other teams and then improve upon our own based on what we saw other teams ideas (specifically teams 2,6,10); specifics about these teams has been completed in the DFD lvl 1 assignment. With this information we will work on finalizing our requirements and design elements and make a WBS to hopefully get going with development soon.
