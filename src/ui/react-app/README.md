# FILES AND THEIR PURPOSE

1. index.html (don't edit)
html actually being run in browser, imports from main.jsx. Best not to edit.

2. src/main.jsx (don't edit)
imports app.jsx and renders the resulting object

3. App.jsx (edit this to main screen UI)
responsible for the main screen, imports different pages.

4. index.css (our default CSS, cautiously edit)
this is our default css. changing this may have unexpected results. Change this when you want to make sweeping changes to CSS such as default fonts or default styles for specific element types.

5. App.css (edit this to edit css)
this is the actual css being used by our app.jsx, edit this to make changes to css styling, better to use this for creating/changing styles with specific IDs.
